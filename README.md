# Steam Games Clustering
This project is my first machine learning project as I start my journey into the world of data science!

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to find clusters of similar games in terms of reviews and price. I want to know which games are the most bang for my buck.

### Methods Used
* Kmodes clustering
* Linear regression
* Webscraping
* Data Cleaning and feature generation

### Technologies
* Python & Beautifulsoup
* HTML
* IPython & Jupyter Notebook
* Kmodes Package

## Project Description
I am an avid gamer. I always wanted to know if better games cost more money to play, or if they just went on sale less often. Thus, I acquired data for over 25,000 games off the Steam website (https://store.steampowered.com/search/?) to see how many games fall under the "cheaper with bad reviews" category. 

However, due to complications and my inexperience later on into the project, I had to change course and instead ask a different question: To what extent do reviews affect the selling prices of games? This complication, as well as my entire process, will be explained down below.
